# Global_Air_pollution_analysis

Due to urbanization, the air pollution is increasing – for this have chosen 12 countries over an 8-year period and explanation is backed by the World Bank’s “Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Data”. (Indicator #75)
Leveraged Data Vignette such as graphs, because we get to see the trends of PM2.5 – how much and the rate of rise in pollution levels YoY. If it’s a national channel, it would be broadcasted to wider audience.
Hypothesis:- I would like to establish that increasing urbanization is causing air pollution to increase over an 8/10-year period.
Air Pollution levels in some countries are rising mainly due to:
  Increased construction activity – 
    big commercial establishments like IT Parks/SEZs even near residential areas 
    construction of high-rise apartments, most of which are unoccupied - more than what’s necessary at the moment especially in Metropolitan and Cosmopolitan cities (Supply > Demand)
  Increased vehicular emissions (especially Developing Countries) – 
    roads aren’t optimized for traffic flow and vehicles getting stuck in traffic jams for hours. 
    In addition, Diesel vehicles (>2000cc) should not be allowed to ply if score on the pollution certificate is less than the threshold value.
Users would get/gain “Actionable Insights” provided by the “Predictions”, enabling them to take “Prescriptive” measures. In this scenario, the policy makers could act on the insights in a timely way and direct the concerned officials to mitigate the reduction of air pollution. 
Possible Solutions / measures to reduce air pollution levels (based on the predictions of our model): 
• Approvals not to be given for construction of high-rise / commercial buildings near residential areas. 
•  Better traffic flow management through construction of radial roads, multi-lane wide roads, flyovers etc.

I worked on this project during one of the courses I took as part of my Full time MBA with Business Analytics program at the University of Pittsburgh.
